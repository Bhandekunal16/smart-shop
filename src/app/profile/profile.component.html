    <p>
      What happens when I update my email address (or mobile number)? Your login
      email id (or mobile number) changes, likewise.
      <br />You'll receive all your account related communication on your
      updated email address (or mobile number).
      <br />
      When will my account be updated with the new email address (or mobile
      number)? It happens as soon as you confirm the verification code sent to
      your email (or mobile) and save the changes. <br />
      What happens to my existing account when I update my email address (or
      mobile number)? Updating your email address (or mobile number) doesn't
      invalidate your account. <br />
      Your account remains fully functional. You'll continue seeing your Order
      history, saved information and personal details. Does my Seller account
      get affected when I update my email address? has a 'single sign-on'
      policy.
      <br />Any changes will reflect in your Seller account also.
